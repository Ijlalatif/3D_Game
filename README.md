# **3D Platformer Game**

A **3D platformer game** built with **Unity**, where the player navigates a floating course, moves in all directions, and tries to avoid obstacles.

## **Game Overview**

In this game, the player controls a character that moves forward in the air and can navigate **left**, **right**, and **backward**. Pressing the backward key causes the player to fall. The objective is to avoid obstacles; touching an obstacle changes its color to **red** and ends the game.

## **Features**

- **3D Platforming**: Move the character forward, backward, left, and right in a 3D environment.
- **Dynamic Obstacles**: Obstacles react when touched, changing color to **red**.
- **Game Over Mechanics**: Contact with an obstacle results in a "Game Over" state.

## **How to Play**

1. **Movement**: Use the forward, backward, left, and right keys to move in each direction.
2. **Falling**: Press the backward key to fall down quickly.
3. **Avoid Obstacles**: Touching obstacles will end the game by turning them red.
